## An example basic

```
python OCR.py 
- char:       #represents the character you wanna detect
- imagename:  #specify the image name, which will be saved at current directory. The blurred image is saved as blurred.png
```



**Note:** OCR.py contains three functions that help complete the detection process: 

* change the character to an image
* blur the image

* google tesseract detection

## Must-be libraries:

- Google Tesseract
- OpenCV
